## Preface
Notice: This document covers general ideas around syntax formatting and does not dive deeply into any specific language(s). If you would like to check out individual languages and how they inherit these guidelines, head over to their individual folders.

This syntax and format is not for a person who has minimal or grasp on a language/toolkit OR for writing code that is not meant to be read by a human. For a beginner, it is recommended to learn the fundamentals before adopting this styling in order to understand how to PROPERLY order certain structures, follow lexical scoping, and allowed syntax.

General ideas covered include those that can be found in all languages that are commonly used:
* Naming Conventions
* Brackets Styling
* Condensing & Inlining
