A documentation of a way to organize code to make it much more readable and easier to navigate.

This documentation includes styling that can apply to these languages:
1. Java (8+ Compliant)
2. C/C++ (98 Compliant, 98 Compliant)
3. Haxe 
4. Dart (Optional)
5. JavaScript

This documentation also features specific languages that have indepth overviews for:
 * [Java](./java/)




## <strong>Why?</strong>
The main motive behind having a different formatting for my code is that
it suits me much more than the blue book of the language itself. Although it might seem messy at first, for some of these languages like Java and Haxe, these expanded syntax helps to reveal important attributes in the verbose languages. By reducing the visbility of irrelevant modifiers, keywords, and symbols we can then extrapolate the functionalities we might care about. 

## <strong>General formula</strong>
All of the syntax formatting follow a similar guideline for all languages if they have similar combination of symbols and/or keywords. You can check these out [here](/.global/)
